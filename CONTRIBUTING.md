### Submitting Issues

Before submitting an issue to this project, you must be sure that the issue is specific to the MavensMate **core**, in other words, it's not a text editor specific issue. Please also **search first** before submitting a new issue.

When submitting a new issue, you must specify the following:

1. Your platform (OSX, Linux, Windows) and architecture (32 or 64 bit)
2. The MavensMate version(s), i.e. MavensMate plugin version and MavensMate-app version
3. **Specific** steps to reproduce
4. MavensMate logs. Configure logging via MavensMate-app settings, run your failing operation to generate logs, and paste relevant logs to your issue.
5. If relevant, your Salesforce server (e.g., cs18, c31, na7, etc.)

If any of the above are missing, we will be unable to properly diagnose your issue.
