## Active Plugins

### MavensMate for Sublime Text

MavensMate for Sublime Text is a Sublime Text plugin that uses the `mm` command line tool to provide a rich IDE experience in the editor. The bulk of the MM for ST codebase is used focused on integration with the Sublime Text APIs. The interaction with the Force.com APIs are still handled by `mm`.
